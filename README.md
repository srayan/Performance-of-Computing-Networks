S[n+1] = (k * S[n]) MOD m The values of the variables are: S[0] = 1111 k = 16807 m = 2147483647 I have calculate 10000 values  S[0] to S[9999]




# File --> ExponentialPseudoRandomNumberGenerator.py
Generating pseudo-random numbers following equation:
y = -(1 / lambda) * ln (r)
lambda = 2
r being the 10000 pseudo-random numbers generated using the multiplicative congruential method.
Calculating 10000 values and appending to y
Calculating mean and variance of this exponential distribution and comparing with theoretical values (where mean = 1 / lambda and variance = (1 / lambda)^2
